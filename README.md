A nicaraguan news source project

I am building this project to learn how to work with APIs and also because I would like to build something useful.

My wife's family is from Nicaragua and because of the recent political problems they are very aware of what is going on with their country on a daily basis.
I thought I could write a program that would use a news API to aggregate all news articles related to Nicaragua so all they would have to do is visit this webapp and scroll through the different news articles.

Thank you to https://newsapi.org/ for providing the API.


If you have any questions or have any ideas on how I can improve it please let me know.
